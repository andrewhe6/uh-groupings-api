## What This Project Does
A Spring Boot (Java 21) REST API that serves as middleware between the UH Groupings UI and the Internet2 **Grouper** enterprise access management system. It manages UH group memberships (basis, include, exclude, owners subgroups) and exposes them through a JWT-secured REST API at `/api/groupings/v2.1`.

## Architecture Overview

```
UI → GroupingsRestControllerv2_1
        └──→ Service Layer (GroupingAssignmentService, UpdateMemberService, etc.)
                └──→ GrouperService (interface)
                        └──→ GrouperApiService (registered by `GrouperPropertyConfigurer`)
                                   ↓
                             ExecutorService (retry logic, up to 2 retries)
                                   ↓
                             GrouperCommand subclasses (wrapper/)
                                   ↓
                             Grouper WS Client (GrouperClient library)
```

**Two-layer response model:**
- `src/.../wrapper/` — thin wrappers around raw Grouper `Ws*` beans (e.g., `HasMembersResults`, `SubjectsResults`)
- `src/.../groupings/` — API-facing DTOs returned to the UI (e.g., `GroupingAddResult`, `MembershipResults`)

## Core Domain Model

### Grouping Structure
Every grouping is identified by a path (e.g., `hawaii:its:groupings:test-grouping`) and has four subgroups:
- `{path}:basis` — source of truth (e.g., all faculty from LDAP)
- `{path}:include` — additional members to add
- `{path}:exclude` — members to remove
- `{path}:owners` — users/groups who can manage this grouping

Path validation: `[\\w-:.]+` regex, max 255 characters.

### Membership Logic
**Effective membership = (basis + include) - exclude**

- A user is a member if they are in basis OR include, AND not in exclude
- Opt-in moves a user from exclude to include
- Opt-out moves a user from include to exclude
- Basis members cannot be removed unless they are also in exclude

### Ownership Model
Owners manage a grouping and can add/remove members, change attributes, etc.

**Direct owners:** Individual users in the `:owners` group.

**Indirect owners (owner-groupings):** Groups used as owners. Members of these groups inherit owner privileges.

**Duplicate owners:** Users who are both direct owners AND members of owner-groupings. Tracked separately to prevent accidental removal.

**Owner limit:** Configurable maximum to prevent excessive ownership.

## Authorization & Authentication

### JWT-Based Authorization
Stateless JWT tokens populate `SecurityContextHolder` before every request. Tokens contain roles: `ROLE_ADMIN`, `ROLE_OWNER`.

**Use JWT checks for general authorization:**
- `memberService.isCurrentUserAdmin()` — checks JWT for ROLE_ADMIN
- `memberService.isCurrentUserOwner()` — checks JWT for ROLE_OWNER

These are fast, local checks used in service methods for authorization decisions.

### Grouper-Based Authorization
Queries Grouper to determine roles. Used during login to populate JWT tokens.

**Use Grouper checks for role population endpoints:**
- `memberService.isAdmin(uhIdentifier)` — queries Grouper admin group
- `memberService.isOwner(uhIdentifier)` — queries Grouper owners group
- `memberService.isOwner(groupingPath, uhIdentifier)` — checks if user owns specific grouping

### Public vs Protected Endpoints
**Public endpoints (no JWT required):**
- `/v3/api-docs/**` — OpenAPI documentation
- `/swagger-ui/**` — Swagger UI
- `/api/groupings/v2.1/announcements/**` — system announcements

**Protected endpoints (JWT required):**
- All other `/api/groupings/v2.1/**` endpoints

## Critical Patterns

### Command/Wrapper Pattern
All Grouper calls use a Command pattern. `GrouperCommand<T>` is the abstract base; `ExecutorService.execute()` runs the command with retry logic.

```
// GrouperApiService delegates to ExecutorService:
exec.execute(new HasMembersCommand()
    .assignGroupPath(groupPath)
    .addUhIdentifier(uhIdentifier)
    .setRetry(true));
```

Never call Grouper WS beans directly — always go through a `*Command` class in `wrapper/`.

**Command classes:** `HasMembersCommand`, `AddMembersCommand`, `RemoveMembersCommand`, `FindGroupsCommand`, `SubjectsCommand`, `GetMembersCommand`, `GroupAttributeCommand`, `AssignAttributesCommand`, `AssignGrouperPrivilegesCommand`, etc.

### UH Identifier Handling
A UH identifier is either an 8-digit numeric UUID (`^\\d{8}$`) or a string username. `GrouperCommand.isUhUuid()` determines which Grouper lookup field to populate.

```
protected WsSubjectLookup subjectLookup(String uhIdentifier) {
    WsSubjectLookup lookup = new WsSubjectLookup();
    if (isUhUuid(uhIdentifier)) {
        lookup.setSubjectId(uhIdentifier);  // 8-digit UUID
    } else {
        lookup.setSubjectIdentifier(uhIdentifier);  // username
    }
    return lookup;
}
```

This distinction must be preserved everywhere identifiers are used.

A lookup can also name the subject source to search (`subjectLookup(uhIdentifier, sourceId)`). Without one, Grouper
searches every subject source for each identifier, which takes about five times longer (15 ms vs 3 ms per identifier
on grouper-test). Bulk validation (`SubjectService.validateUhIdentifiers`) first looks identifiers up in the source of UH
people (`groupings.api.grouper.person-source-id`, `UH core LDAP`), then looks up the ones not found there in every
source, and returns each valid identifier's source (`UhIdentifierValidationResult.getSubjectSourceIds()`). The adds and
removes of `UpdateMemberService.moveGroupMembers` then look each member up in that source only.

### Async Operations
`UpdateMemberService` uses `@Async` for long-running operations. `AsyncJobsManager` tracks in-flight jobs.

**Flow:**
1. Controller calls async method (e.g., `addIncludeMembersAsync()`)
2. Method returns `CompletableFuture<T>` immediately
3. Controller returns job ID (202 ACCEPTED)
4. Caller polls `/api/groupings/v2.1/jobs/{jobId}` for results
5. `AsyncJobResult` contains status and result. If the job failed, polling rethrows the job's real exception, so it maps to its own status (e.g. 503 when Grouper is unavailable, 403 when access is denied) rather than a generic 500

An async method does its work in its own body, on the async executor's thread (`AsyncConfig`), and returns
`CompletableFuture.completedFuture(result)`. Don't hand the work to `CompletableFuture.supplyAsync()` without an
executor: that runs it on the JVM's shared common pool, where a long import can hold up other jobs. An import holds
its thread for the whole import, so `AsyncConfig` starts all 10 of its threads before it queues a job.

**Progress:** `addIncludeMembersAsync` and `addExcludeMembersAsync` report their progress in an `AsyncJobProgress` that
the controller creates and puts with the job (`AsyncJobsManager.putJob(job, progress)`). While the job is
`IN_PROGRESS`, polling returns it as `progress`: the phase (`VALIDATING`, `REMOVING` or `ADDING`) and how many of the
phase's identifiers Grouper has answered (`done` of `total`), counted per finished batch.

**Async methods:**
- `addIncludeMembersAsync()`
- `addExcludeMembersAsync()`
- `resetIncludeGroupAsync()`
- `resetExcludeGroupAsync()`
- `memberAttributeResultsAsync()`

### Retry & Failure Handling
`ExecutorService.execute()` retries failed commands up to 2 times with exponential backoff.

```
for (int i = 0; i <= MAX_RETRIES; i++) {  // 0, 1, 2
    try {
        result = command.execute();
        if (result.getResultCode().startsWith("SUCCESS")) {
            return result;
        }
    } catch (Exception e) {
        ex = e;
    }
    if (!retry || i == MAX_RETRIES) break;
    delay(i);  // 1s * i
}
throw new GrouperException(...);
```

**Retry conditions:**
- Only if `command.setRetry(true)` was called
- Delay: 1 second × attempt number (1s, 2s)
- Max 2 retries (3 total attempts)
- Throws `GrouperException` if all retries fail

### Bulk Request Batching
`GrouperApiService.getSubjects(List)`, `addMembers` and `removeMembers` send a long list through `BatchExecutor`, as
Grouper requests of at most a batch size of identifiers each, and merge the batch results (`SubjectsResults.merge`,
`AddMembersResults.merge`, `RemoveMembersResults.merge`), so callers get the same result as from one request.

| Request | Batch size | Batches at once |
|---|---|---|
| Lookup (`getSubjects`) | `lookup-batch-size` (1000) | up to `max-concurrent-requests` (4) |
| Remove (`removeMembers`) | `update-batch-size` (250) | up to `max-concurrent-requests` (4) |
| Add (`addMembers`) | `update-batch-size` (250) | 1 |

(Properties under `groupings.api.grouper.`.) Measured on grouper-test (Grouper WS 2.2.2): a lookup takes about 3 ms per
identifier with its subject source named (see UH Identifier Handling); an add or remove about 115 ms per member;
re-adding a listed member about 13 ms.

- Why batches: Grouper answers only after processing every subject in a request, so one request for a large import
  outlasts the Grouper client's socket timeout (`grouperClient.webService.httpSocketTimeoutMillis`, 480 s).
- The concurrent batches of all lookups and removals share one pool of `max-concurrent-requests` threads, which caps
  the bulk requests one API instance sends at once. 4 lookups of 1,000 take about as long as one.
- Adds are sent one batch at a time: Grouper fails most of the members of concurrent adds to the same group with
  `EXCEPTION` (it conflicts updating the group's `last_membership_change`). For the same reason, two adds of more than
  one batch to the same group in one API instance wait for each other. Concurrent removes don't conflict.
- A batch is sent again, after each of `retry-delays-millis` (5 s, 15 s), when it failed without an answer from
  Grouper (an I/O error, or a response that isn't Grouper's) or when Grouper reports only `EXCEPTION` for its failed
  members. Any other failure would fail again and is thrown at once. `ExecutorService`'s own retry isn't used, since it
  treats a lookup batch in which nothing resolves as a failure.
- Batches are not one transaction: once a batch fails, no more are started and the failure is thrown, but the batches
  that succeeded stay applied. Re-adding a listed member (`SUCCESS_ALREADY_EXISTED`) or removing an unlisted one
  (`SUCCESS_WASNT_IMMEDIATE`) succeeds, so a failed batch can be sent again and the whole operation repeated.
- Each lookup batch in every source collapses its own unresolved identifiers into one `SUBJECT_NOT_FOUND` entry, so a
  merged lookup can hold several. `SubjectService` matches results to identifiers by uid and UH number, never by
  position or count.
- A new `GrouperApiService` operation that takes a list as long as an import should also go through `BatchExecutor`
  (`lookup`, `add` or `remove`), with a `merge` method on its results wrapper.
- Moving a list longer than one update batch into include or exclude (`UpdateMemberService.moveGroupMembers`) first
  fetches the opposite list's member ids (one request, without subject details) and removes only the identifiers
  listed there, instead of sending every identifier for a removal that does nothing. Its `removeResults` then lists
  only those.

### Validation & Sanitization
Input validation happens at multiple layers:

**Path validation:**
- Regex: `[\\w-:.]+`
- Max length: 255 characters
- `GroupPathService.checkPath()` validates before operations

**UH identifier validation:**
- 8-digit UUID or username
- `SubjectService.getValidUhUuid()` resolves and validates
- Throws `UhIdentifierNotFoundException` if not found

**Description validation:**
- Regex pattern (configurable)
- Max length (configurable, default 255)
- HTML sanitization using OWASP sanitizer
- `GroupingAttributeService.validateAndSanitizeDescription()`

### Timestamp Updates
After successful Grouper operations, `UpdateTimestampService.update()` updates the `:lastModified` attribute on affected groups.

```
if (grouperService instanceof GrouperApiService) {
    timestampService.update(result);
}
```

Only called in production (not in test profiles). Tracks when groupings were last modified.

## Build & Test Commands
```bash
# Run the app (requires overrides properties file)
./mvnw clean spring-boot:run

# Unit tests only (no Grouper network access required)
./mvnw clean test

# Run a single test class or method
./mvnw clean test -Dtest=GroupPathServiceTest
./mvnw clean test -Dtest=GroupPathServiceTest#isGroupingPath

# Integration tests (require live Grouper credentials)
./mvnw clean test -Dtest='Test*'

# Build WAR
./mvnw clean package
```

## Spring Profiles
| Profile           | Use case                                                                               |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `localhost`       | Local dev; imports `~/.$(whoami)-conf/uh-groupings-api-overrides.properties`           |
| `localTest`       | Unit tests with mocked/no Grouper (`GrouperApiServiceTest`)                            |
| `integrationTest` | Integration tests hitting live Grouper (`TestGrouperApiService`)                       |
| `dockerhost`      | Docker-based local runtime; imports `/overrides/uh-groupings-api-overrides.properties` |
| `prod`            | Production deployment                                                                  |

## Test Naming Convention
- `*Test.java` (e.g., `GrouperApiServiceTest`) — unit/local tests, `@ActiveProfiles("localTest")`
- `Test*.java` (e.g., `TestGrouperApiService`) — integration tests, `@ActiveProfiles("integrationTest")`, require live Grouper

## Adding a New Grouper Operation
1. Create a `*Command` class in `wrapper/` extending `GrouperCommand<T>` (builder pattern, fluent API).
2. Create matching `*Results` wrapper in `wrapper/` implementing `Results` interface.
3. Add a method to `GrouperService` interface.
4. Implement in `GrouperApiService` using `exec.execute(new YourCommand()...)`.
5. Create a service method in appropriate service class (e.g., `GroupingAssignmentService`).
6. Add controller endpoint in `GroupingsRestControllerv2_1`.
7. Write unit tests in `*Test.java` and integration tests in `Test*.java`.
8. Update the AGENTS.md file with new endpoint documentation.
